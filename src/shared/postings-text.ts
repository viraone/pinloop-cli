/**
 * Every sentence Pinloop puts in front of a person about the job postings an
 * account has been handed (docs/postings-release-slice-1-criteria.md, approved
 * by Andrew 2026-09-12; specs/feature-posting-allowance.md).
 *
 * Every account has a number of job postings it may be handed. An account that
 * pays gets 1,500 over the two dates Stripe charged it for, and an account that
 * pays nothing gets five over one day measured in UTC, and ten on the day the
 * account was created. A search charges one posting for each card on the page
 * this account has never been handed before, and a posting this account has been
 * handed before comes back free, forever.
 *
 * Four things get said about that, and they are said here so the wording is
 * changed in one place: the line printed after a search, the refusal when a
 * search could take more than the account has left, the message that stops a big
 * search so the person can be asked first, and the line the bare `pinloop`
 * command prints.
 *
 * This file holds nothing but text a person reads. It writes nothing to the
 * terminal itself and raises no error: every function here hands a sentence back
 * to whoever is printing it. That is what lets the installed `pinloop` command
 * and the server build the same sentence out of the same words, which matters
 * because the numbers are the server's and the printing is the command's.
 *
 * Nothing here names a dollar figure or a supplier. To a person there is one job
 * board, Pinloop, and a search is a search (src/cli/printed-messages.test.ts
 * holds both rules). The sentences that do name what Pro costs live in
 * src/shared/plan-text.ts, and the functions below take the offer as an argument
 * and append the paragraph that hands it to the person, so there is still one
 * file holding every sentence about money (Andrew, 2026-09-14).
