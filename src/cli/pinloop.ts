/**
 * The `pinloop` command line program.
 *
 * The line above is what lets the compiled file run as a command in its own
 * right. package.json points the name `pinloop` at the compiled copy of this
 * file, so `npm link` here — or `npm install -g` from a clone — puts a working
 * `pinloop` on the PATH, and the spec's `pinloop login` is what a person
 * actually types.
 *
 * It holds no database credential and knows no SQL. Everything it does is one
 * HTTP call to the hosted Pinloop server: create an account, log in, search,
 * list, fetch, look an employer up by name, store and read back the account's
 * own profile documents, or keep named lists of postings in the account's own
 * tabs. The one verb that calls nothing at all is
 * `filter`, which works on rows another command already printed. The only thing
 * it keeps on disk is the pass the server handed back at login, written to
 * credentials.json with owner-only permissions — the same treatment an ssh
 * private key gets — and refused outright if anybody widens those permissions
 * later. That pass is good for about an hour; when it runs out, the same file's
 * renewal token buys a new one on the spot, so the command a person typed still
 * works and nobody has to log in by hand.
 *
 * Three verbs print text and take no rows at all. `welcome` prints what Pinloop
 * is, the short instruction file for a coding agent to save, and the first steps
 * to work through with the person. `skill` prints that instruction file on its
 * own. `guide` prints the full instructions, built by walking this program's own
 * list of commands, so they describe the copy installed here and never a newer
 * one. Typing `pinloop` with nothing after it prints what the account holds.
 *
 * Every verb prints the same two shapes, so one verb's output is the next
 * verb's input. With --json, standard output carries one JSON object and
 * nothing else: a `rows` array, plus `cursor` where paging applies. Anything a
 * person needs to read but a following command must not swallow — the report of
 * what filter dropped, an error, a warning — goes to standard error instead.
 *
 * This file and everything it imports are meant to be publishable on their own,
 * as an npm package a stranger installs without getting the server with it. So
 * it may import from src/cli/ and from src/shared/, and from the `commander`
 * package, and from nothing else. src/cli/package-boundary.test.ts walks the
 * imports from here and fails naming the file and the import if anything else
 * gets in, and scripts/pack-cli.mjs walks the compiled copies the same way and
 * refuses to build the package rather than shipping server code by accident.
 * When this program needs something the server also needs, the thing moves into
 * src/shared/ rather than being imported across.
 * The server's search route calls its array `results`; this program renames it
 * to `rows` on the way out so a person at a terminal only ever meets one name.
 *
 * A search answer also carries the server's report of what it actually searched
 * for: which match mode it used, how many postings it was willing to score, and
 * which spellings of each typed word it looked for. With --json that report is
 * one more key beside `rows` and `cursor`, so a program that only reads `rows`
 * is unaffected by it. Without --json the postings are still the only thing on
 * standard output, and the report is written as one plain sentence to standard
 * error, where a person reads it and the next command in a pipe never sees it.

 * one is simply remembered as well and handed back, which is what makes it the
 * answer.
 *
 * The last line therefore reaches `onLine` too. Both callers parse the line and
 * drop anything that is not a progress event they act on: the routine run
 * command acts only on `step-started`, and the judge command's `watchProgress`
 * drops any line with no `kind` in it, which is every answer either route ever
 * returns. The one answer that does carry a `kind` is the failure line a run

 * `--all` means "do not stop at one page: keep asking for the next one until
 * there are no more, and print the whole thing once".
 *
 * Without it, a command that pages hands back one page and the handle for the
 * next one, and following that handle is the caller's job. That is the right
 * default for reading at a terminal and the wrong one for a pipe, where the
 * command after the pipe wants everything that matched, not the first hundred
 * of it. With `--all` the program asks for pages of a hundred — the largest the
 * server will hand over at once — and follows the handle it gets back until the
 * server stops giving one, then prints one result: with `--json`, the usual
 * object holding every row from every page in the order they arrived and a
 * `cursor` of null, because there is nothing left to follow; without `--json`,
 * the same readable output the command always prints, for every row.
 *
 * One run may fetch at most five thousand postings. The first request of a run
 * says that it is the first request of a run, and the server counts how many
 * postings the conditions match before it fetches anything: a run over that
 * ceiling is refused in one sentence naming how many matched, rather than being
 * served the first of a hundred and eighty-six pages
 * (specs/feature-pull-ceiling.md). Five thousand postings is fifty pages, and an
 * account may make a hundred and twenty requests a minute, so a run that is
 * allowed at all finishes without ever being told to wait. If a page is refused
 * anyway — the allowance spent on something else, or the server busy — the
 * program waits and asks for the same page again rather than failing or skipping
 * it. Every wait is said out loud on standard error, so a run that is crawling
 * says so rather than looking hung.
 *
 * Everything printed about the progress of the fetching goes to standard error.
 * Standard output carries the result and nothing else, because a pipe reads
 * standard output and would choke on a progress line.

   * There is no `pinloop signup` any more, and no password anywhere in this

   * the account at that moment; every later sign-in opens the same account. So
   * one command is the whole of the way in, and a person never has to know
   * whether they already have an account.
   *
   * What happens, in order. This command starts a small web server inside its own
   * process, listening on 127.0.0.1, which is the address a machine uses to talk
   * to itself. It prints the web address of the sign-in page, carrying the port
   * it is listening on and a one-time secret it invented, and on a machine that
   * has a browser it also opens that address itself. The person signs in on that
   * page with Google, with GitHub, or with a 6-digit code Pinloop emails them,
   * and the script inside the page hands the pass back to the port this command
   * named. When the browser is on a different machine from this terminal — over
   * SSH, which is where this happens — nothing answers on that port, so the page
   * shows a short code instead and this command takes it typed in here.
   *
   * The address is printed even on a machine where the browser is opened, because
   * the person running this command is often a coding agent and the human does
   * the browser part on their own screen.
   *
   * `--code` (or the PINLOOP_LOGIN_CODE environment variable) finishes a
   * sign-in with that same short code and nothing else: it never opens the
   * small web server above, so it works in a process that never ran `pinloop
   * login` and never saw the address this command printed. This is what a
   * coding agent runs after a person has finished signing in in their own
   * browser, because a coding agent has no prompt to paste a code into and,
   * on Windows, no way to receive one over a named pipe either. The flag wins

   * `pinloop billing`: open the page where a Pinloop subscription is set up,

   *
   * A card cannot be typed into a terminal, so the whole job of this command is
   * to hand a person a web address and, on a machine that has a browser, open it
   * for them. The address is printed as well, never only opened, for the two
   * reasons `pinloop login` prints its address: the person running the command
   * is often a coding agent while the human is looking at a browser on another
   * screen, and a rented machine reached over SSH has no browser at all.
   *
   * The server decides which address this is. An account that pays nothing gets
   * Pinloop's own payment page, carrying a one-time code that says which account
   * is paying. An account that already pays gets Stripe's own page for its
   * customer, which is where cancelling a subscription and replacing an expired
   * card happen. This command never learns which of the two it got, which is why
   * the line it prints is true either way.
   *
   * `pinloop upgrade` runs the same command. Andrew rejected `upgrade` as the
   * only name on 2026-08-21, because somebody who wants to cancel or replace a
   * card would never think to type the word upgrade; it stays as a second name so
   * that a person who guesses it is not told they guessed wrong.

 * is the same JSON every other verb prints, so the next command in the pipe
 * reads it without knowing a routine was involved. The report of what each step
